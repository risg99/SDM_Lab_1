# SDM_Lab_1

This is laboratory 1 for the Semantic Data Management Course of BDMA - Semester 2 at UPC. The tasks done in the lab include: presenting our own graph model (visual as well as actual implementation) for the problem statement, creating instances and loading data in the graph, evolving the graph to interpret its extension and finally executing some queries and algorithms on the created graph.
